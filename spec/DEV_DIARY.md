# Development Diary

## 2025-12-22

### Milestones
- **Project Structure**: Repository reset and synced to pierre-charlesworth/lab-tools.
- **UI Framework**: Implemented Premium Glassmorphism design system (M3 tokens).
- **App Shell**: Created Sidebar, Dashboard, and Theme Toggle (Light/Dark).
- **CI/CD**: Fixed Vercel build issues (package.json syntax, git conflicts).

### Current State
- **Repo**: https://github.com/pierre-charlesworth/lab-tools (Branch: main)
- **Active Task**: Task 3 - Calculator Component Refactor.
  - Status: Initially blocked by git conflicts (now resolvd). Checking if code was updated.

### Next Steps
- **Verification**: Verify Calculator Refactor.
- **Task 4**: Timer Component Refactor.

- **Task 3 Verification**: Passed 
pm run build. Calculator Refactor is complete and type-safe.

- **Task 4 Improvement**: M3TextField extracted. TimerView refactor was deferred due to complexity. Issuing Task 4b.

- **Task 4b Status**: Previous attempt resulted in a detailed plan but no code execution. Re-issuing focused task for TimerView.tsx refactor.

- **Task 4b Verification**: TimerView.tsx refactor passed build. Glassmorphism enabled. MiniTimerCard remains pending.

- **Task 4 Verification**: MiniTimerCard.tsx refactor complete and verified. All Timer components now satisfy M3/Glassmorphism requirements. Build Passed.
